\chapter{Introduction}

If we could name one key concept, that drives most of human daily activies, then the answer would be opinion. 
Opinions acompanied by emotions, attitudes and sentiments, help people to navigate through their daily lives.
These concepts gain even more importance, in the era of Internet - where opinion expresion has become easier 
than ever before. Tools such as e-commerce and forums, allow us to share expeirence as well as opinions. 
Social media further aid our ability to exchange ideas, attitudes, and emotions. Intensive usage of such tools 
has filled internet with gigabytes of raw opinionated data waiting to be processed and analised.

This is when "Opinion mining", comes to stage. Opinion mining, interchangeably named Sentiment Analisys (\ac{sa}),
 is an area of study of natural language processing, focusing on extraction of opinions from natural language texts
\ac{sa} is very important to study, beacuse of it's wide spread applications. It's applications range
from marketing to social sciences The field has been studied a while before social media arrivial, by data mining
however due to lack of big opionanted datasets the field developed slowly. Rapid spread of socialmedia, provided some
fresh air for the field. Altough important, the field is quite chalenging as it stumbles upon many problems unresearched before.

\ac{sa} researches many different aspects of opinions in texts. One of the most prominent aspects is
positive or negative attiude discrimination. This one is particuraly interesing from the marketing point of view. 
Knowledge about market overall attitude torwards companies products, enables it to adjust it's offer and, or marketing techniques.
Usable as it may be attitude discrimination not only is a challenge but also introduces a problem of it's own. 
Opinnins may only be efficently exracted from opinionated texts. There is no way to know a priori wheter particular comment 
in social service, will be opinion carriing or not. This problem gives rise to another branch of 
sentiment analisysy  - subjectivity discrimination.

Subjectivity discrimination aims at dividing input texts into two groups, First one of them is the objective group. 
Only texts mentioning facts, containing absolute statements, and refering to verifiable information are considered objective. 
The other group  subjective group, holds texts containing information based on speaker knowlage and emotions 
it's neither absolute nor verifiable. Depending on application it may be necessary to preform subjectivity detection on diffrent
levels, each of which may impose dificullities of it's own.  

\section{ Goal }


The task at hand seems chalenging even for humans, and yet researchers around the world have proposed interesting methods
for performing this task. Some of those methods offer insuficent accuracy for practial usage. Othres are impractically complex
in computation. Moreover most of them seem to work only on sepcific datasets and domains. 

This thesis is focuesd on sentence level subjectivity discrimination. The aim is to provide a brief overview of available methods
for subjectivity discrimination, provide improvements on  methods and perform in depth performance analysys, focusing escepcially on method application on unprocessed comments. 
Firstly, datasets used in performance evaluation will be described and briefly analised. Next gathered methods will be presented and described, 
Next step will go through, tasks that where performed to detect and ensure best performance of methods. Finally results from tests performed on gold 
standart datasets as well as raw comments will be presented
